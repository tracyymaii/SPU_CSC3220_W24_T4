Water Tracker - 

We plan on creating a water tracker that will run on mainly hand held devices, that being ios and/or android devices. This water tracker can be edited in the app for water goals, and pop-up reminders for the user to drink water. The user will be able to track their daily water intake, that will get logged into a weekly, monthly, yearly chart. Hopefully we can also make it into a phone widget so the user cam see their water level on their home screen and edit it from there too. The technologies that we will be using will be detailed as we continue the class.
